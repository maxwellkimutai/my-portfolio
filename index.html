        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My names are Maxwell Kimutai Ngetich. I have two elder brothers and one younger sister. I have been passionate about coding and music since I was a young boy. After high school I decided to pursue my love for music by becoming a deejay. I enrolled at a deejay school and the rest is history. I love nature and my dream is to travel to different countries once I have enough funds(is it ever enough though?).</p>
        <h2>Education & Job Experience</h2>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science but I have been to the following educational institutions</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Riara Group of Schools</li>
          <li>Kabark Highschool</li>
          <li>Millenuim Academy</li>
          <li>Africa Nazarene University</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I have one years experience working in an IT firm working as an IT offices. My tasks include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Managing company IT projects</li>
          <li>IT support</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why Programming?</h2>
        <p>I have always felt excited when people talk about how software is built. The mystery behind the workings of various software sparked my quest to become a world class programmer.I decided to come and study at moringa because of the hands on way of teaching. It helps me as a future developer learn how to look for and teach myself new skills and tricks from resources online.</p>
